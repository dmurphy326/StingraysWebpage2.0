                    Dear Potential Sponsor,<br />
                    <br />
                    H20 Academy is a division of Keep Me Alive, Inc.  We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that focuses on educating 
                    inner city youth about water safety and physical fitness using water for endurance, muscle and stem training. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    H2O Academy utilizes a positive self-image psychology approach to educating and training our students.  It is our belief 
                    that success is a by-product of a positive environment and a positive self-image.  Our programs are geared to help each athlete 
                    realize his/her potential by supporting their efforts in a positive manner; both in and beyond the confines of the pool, track, 
                    and classroom.  H2O Academy strives to instill an understanding of, and appreciation for, such concepts as high self-esteem, 
                    personal accountability, self-discipline, goal setting and goal achievement.  We know that not every athlete in our program will 
                    be an Olympian, but they can all learn, internalize and live the Olympic ideals of vision, focus, persistence, commitment and discipline. 
                    These principles, more than any gold medal or national record, will help each child as they grow and enter the realms of higher education 
                    and society in general.  We strongly feel that if you help nurture the child, you will help develop and even unleash the champion within as well.  
                    Upon completion, each H2O Academy athlete will be certified as a lifeguard and receive assistance to secure scholarships for college.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In order to meet our mission and provide services in our community, we rely on the generosity of individuals and businesses for support.  Without 
                    the assistance of community-minded individuals just like you, we wouldn't be able to provide services for those in our community each year.  We 
                    ask that you commit to becoming a H2O Academy partner by providing sponsorship.  Your generosity will make a difference in our community by allowing 
                    us to continue in our work by providing additional training for our coaches, training clinics for athletes, sponsor out of town meets, and purchase 
                    equipment and uniforms.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The enclosed brochures provides additional information about the programs which H2O Academy supports as well as a sponsorship sheet for you or your 
                    organization to make a contribution today.  We are always excited to develop relationships with our community organizations.  We hope that you will join 
                    us in sharing our vision that we must involve young people in nurturing experiences for them to become positive reflections in our community. Remember 
                    that every donation makes a difference, regardless of size.
